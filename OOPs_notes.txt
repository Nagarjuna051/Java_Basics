Object-Oriented programming Concepts:
    ->The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities
	->oops is faster and easier to execute
	->oops provides a clear structure for the programs
	->The code easier to maintain,modify and debug
The main Features of Java is 
		Object,
		Class,
		Inheritance,
		Polymorphism,
		Abstraction,
		Encapsulation.
		
Object-> Any entity that has state and behavior is know as an object.
         Ex:mouse,keyboard bike
Class-> Collection of objects is called class.it is a logical entity.
        A Class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.
Inheritance-> When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object,it is know as inheritance
              It provides code reuseability.
polymorphism-> If one task is performed in different ways,it is know as polymorphism.
               in java,we use method overloading and method overriding to achive polymorphism
Abstraction-> Hiding internal details and showing functionality is Know as abstaraction.
Encapsulation-> Binding the variables and methods to gether into a single unit are know as encapsulation

       	
####NOTE: after i will upload detail information of oops concepts with examples and programs.
